I would like to acknowledge the invaluable support of my supervisor, Torsten
M{\"o}ller, as well as Michael Sedlmair. Their assistance and experience have
been invaluable these last five years.

In addition, I want to thank all past and present members of the Visualization
and Data Analysis reserach group at the University of Vienna. In particular, I
want to thank Johanna Schlereth, Michael Phillips, Alireza Ghane, Raphael
Sahann, Christoph Kralj, Elena Rudkovsky, Patrick Wolf, Manfred
Klaffenb{\"o}ck, Chrtistoph Langer, Peter Ruch, Jennifer Prengl, Monica Gregor,
Michaela Parzer, and Anne-Marie Faisst\ttwnote{check for others}. The
discussions I've had over these past few years have been many and varied. I
want to thank all of them for their suggestions and assistance in performing my
research.

And last but certainly not least, I want to thank my family for their love,
support, and encouragement throughout my life. Without their support I would
not have left a lucrative but boring career in finance in order to become a
happy student again. Furthermore, I would not have made it through the
most difficult times of my PhD.
