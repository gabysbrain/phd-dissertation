\ttwnote{sliceplorer: manifolds}
Multi-dimensional continuous functions are commonly visualized with 2D slices
or topological views. Here, we explore 1D slices as an alternative approach to
show such functions. Our goal with 1D slices is to combine the benefits of
topological views, that is, screen space efficiency, with those of slices, that
is a close resemblance of the underlying function.  We compare 1D slices to 2D
slices and topological views, first, by looking at their performance with
respect to common function analysis tasks. We also demonstrate 3 usage
scenarios: the 2D sinc function, neural network regression, and optimization
traces. Based on this evaluation, we characterize the advantages and drawbacks
of each of these approaches, and show how interaction can be used to overcome
some of the shortcomings. 


\ttwnote{hypersliceplorer: shapes}
In this paper we present Hypersliceplorer, an algorithm for generating 2D
slices of multi-dimensional shapes defined by a simplical mesh.  Often, slices
are generated by using a parametric form and then constraining parameters to
view the slice. In our case, we developed an algorithm to slice a simplical
mesh of any number of dimensions with a two-dimensional slice.  In order to get
a global appreciation of the multi-dimensional object, we show multiple slices
by sampling a number of different slicing points and projecting the slices into
a single view per dimension pair. These slices are shown in an interactive
viewer which can switch between a global view (all slices) and a local view
(single slice). We show how this method can be used to study regular polytopes,
differences between spaces of polynomials, and multi-objective optimization
surfaces. 


\ttwnote{rendering time paper: rendering time and spheres}
In this paper we present a method for predicting the rendering time to display
multi-dimensional data for the analysis of computer simulations using the
HyperSlice~\cite{Wijk:1993} method with Gaussian process model reconstruction.
Our method relies on a theoretical understanding of how the data points are
drawn on slices and then fits the formula to a user's machine using practical
experiments.  We also describe the typical characteristics of data when
analyzing deterministic computer simulations as described by the statistics
community.  We then show the advantage of carefully considering how many data
points can be drawn in real time by proposing two approaches of how this
predictive formula can be used in a real-world system.
