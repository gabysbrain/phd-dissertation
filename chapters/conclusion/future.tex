\ttwnote{what is left to be done?} My work has had a major focus on using
direct visualization techniques to understand multi-dimensional continuous
spaces. My intention is that this work can be expanded upon to herald in a new
era of multi-dimensional data analysis.  \ttwnote{more} In my opinion, the
major innovations preventing this technique from being used in a broader
application are a library for slicing multi-dimensional spaces and more
user-focused projects. Building on these two thrusts will move
multi-dimensional continuous data analysis to the mainstream.
