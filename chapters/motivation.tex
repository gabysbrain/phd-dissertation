%Thesis: Multi-dimensional spaces are better visualized through slice based views

We live in a three-dimensional world. This is a relatively uncontroversial
statement. Some argue that time also behaves as a dimension but we do not have
control over it thus giving the universe 3.5 dimensions~\cite{Minkowski:1908}.
Nevertheless, ourselves and what we can interact with are in three dimensions.

However, we interact with many phenomena around us that are essentially
multi-dimensional in nature. For example, the weather in a certain location is
determined by the temperature, pressure, humidity, dew point, wind velocity,
wind direction, among others. A change in any of these factors results in a
change in the weather. Each of these factors can be given a ``spatial
embedding.'' Then, they can be viewed as a dimension of some space.  By
``walking'' or navigating through this space we can observe the effect on the
weather due to changes in these parameters. By exploring the relationship
between input factors (temperature, pressure, et cetera) and outputs (the
weather) we can build an understanding on how these factors infuence the
weather.

Understanding multi-dimensional continuous spaces is difficult. As
three-dimensional beings we have real-world analogs for measurement,
angle, and position in three dimensions. We do not have these once we
move beyond three dimensions though. Nevertheless, visual analysis of
these multi-dimensional spaces has produced insights about the
underlying behavior~\cite{Sedlmair:2014}. The issue is how to show more
than three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen. There are several
techniques to do this: dimension reduction, projection, 
topology, linked views, and slicing.

Slice-based views of multi-dimensional continuous spaces have not been explored
as extensively as other options.  This work began with
HyperSlice~\cite{Wijk:1993}. HyperSlice provides the framework for visualizing
multi-dimensional continuous objects as a set of two-dimensional slices
(\autoref{fig:slicing_overview}). HyperSlice extends the idea of slicing
from medical imaging to any number of dimensions. There are $d \choose 2$
subpanels, one for each pair of dimensions. Each panel shows a 2D slice
of the object. The horizontal axis shows one dimension and the vertical 
axis shows another dimension. With 2D slices of solid multi-dimensional objects
color is often used to encode value. 

My work is inspired by the HyperSlice technique. Van Wijk and van Liere
introduced the idea of using slice-based views of multi-dimensional data.
However, they did not expand on what data types and tasks are involved in
multi-dimensional continuous data analysis.  I build on their work,
investigating the usefulness of slice-based views of continuous
multi-dimensional datasets. I also identified tasks involved in
multi-dimensional data analysis. These tasks informed the development of one-
and two-dimensional slice-based views.

In this thesis I will explore
the possibilities of these slice-based views. Through a number of case
study examples, I will demonstrate the power of these views and ways to
address their shortcomings.
