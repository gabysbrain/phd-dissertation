%Thesis: Multi-dimensional spaces are better visualized through slice based views

We live in a three-dimensional world. 
%This is a relatively uncontroversial
%statement. Some argue that time also behaves as a dimension but we do not have
%control over it thus giving the universe 3.5 dimensions~\cite{Minkowski:1908}.
%Nevertheless, ourselves and what we can interact with are in three dimensions.
Ourselves and what we can interact with are in three dimensions.
\ttwnote{The world is continuous}
We learn about the world, first, by studying function plots in high 
school\ttwnote{figure?}. These give an intuitive view of one-dimensional 
phenomena. 
By exploring the relationship
between an input factor
%(temperature, pressure, et cetera) 
and output,
%(the weather) 
we can build an understanding on the relationship between the two.
We can also compare one function plot to another. Visual inspection of these plots
allows us to see common patterns. We can use our pattern recognition ability
to quickly categorize these different plots into different types of function
behavior. These function plots can also be used to describe two-dimensional
phenomena where there are two input factors. In this case we can use the third
dimension or color encoding to show the function value \ttwnote{figure?}. 
From these plots we can also make general statements about the ``shapes'' of
the behavior like how ``peaky'' the function is or if it is monotonically
increasing.

However, we interact with many phenomena around us that are essentially
multi-dimensional in nature. For example, the weather in a certain location is
determined by the temperature, pressure, humidity, dew point, wind velocity,
wind direction, among others. A change in any of these factors results in a
change in the weather. Each of these factors can be given a ``spatial
embedding.'' Then, they can be viewed as a dimension of some space.  By
``walking'' or navigating through this space we can observe the effect on the
weather due to changes in these parameters. 

Understanding multi-dimensional continuous spaces is difficult. As
three-dimensional beings we have real-world analogs for measurement,
angle, and position in three dimensions. We do not have these once we
move beyond three dimensions though. Nevertheless, visual analysis of
these multi-dimensional spaces has produced insights about the
underlying behavior~\cite{Sedlmair:2014}. The issue is how to show more
than three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen. There are several
techniques to do this: dimension reduction, projection, 
topology, linked views, and slicing.

\ttwnote{continuous vs discrete data and mental models}

Slice-based views of multi-dimensional continuous spaces have not been explored
as extensively as other options.  This work began with the advent of
HyperSlice~\cite{Wijk:1993}. HyperSlice provides the framework for visualizing
multi-dimensional continuous objects as a set of two-dimensional slices
(\autoref{fig:slicing_overview}). HyperSlice extends the idea of slicing
from medical imaging to any number of dimensions. There are $d \choose 2$
subpanels, one for each pair of dimensions. Each panel shows a 2D slice
of the object. The horizontal axis shows one dimension and the vertical 
axis shows another dimension. With 2D slices of solid multi-dimensional objects
color is often used to encode value. 

My work is inspired by the HyperSlice technique. Van Wijk and van Liere
introduced the idea of using slice-based views of multi-dimensional data.
However, they did not expand on what data types and tasks are involved in
multi-dimensional continuous data analysis.  I build on their work,
investigating the usefulness of slice-based views of continuous
multi-dimensional datasets. I also identified tasks involved in
multi-dimensional data analysis. These tasks informed the development of one-
and two-dimensional slice-based views.

In this thesis I will explore
the possibilities of these slice-based views. Through a number of case
study examples, I will demonstrate the power of these views and ways to
address their shortcomings.
