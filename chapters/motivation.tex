%Thesis: Multi-dimensional spaces are better visualized through slice based views

We live in a three-dimensional world.  Ourselves and what we can interact with
are in three dimensions.  We learn about our world by studying the various
phenomena around us.  These phenomena are described as continuous processes.
In the beginning of our  education we study function plots in high school.
These give an intuitive view of one-dimensional phenomena.  By exploring the
relationship between an input factor
%(temperature, pressure, et cetera) 
and output,
%(the weather) 
we can build an understanding on the relationship between the two.  We can also
compare one function plot to another. Visual inspection of these plots allows
us to see common patterns. We use our pattern recognition ability to quickly
categorize these different plots into different types of function behavior.
Function plots can also be used to describe two-dimensional phenomena. These
show the effect due to two input factors. In this case we can use the third
dimension or color encoding to show the function value.  From these plots we
can also make general statements about the ``shapes'' of the behavior like how
``peaky'' the function is or if it is monotonically increasing. These shapes
give us intuition into the underlying processes and help us learn about the
world~\cite{Palmer:1999}.

We also interact with many phenomena around us that are essentially
multi-dimensional in nature. For example, the weather in a certain location is
determined by the temperature, pressure, humidity, dew point, wind velocity,
and wind direction, among others. A change in any of the factors results in a
change in the weather. Each of these factors can be given a ``spatial
embedding.'' Then, they can be viewed as a dimension of some space.  By
``walking'' or navigating through this space we can observe the effect on the
weather due to changes in these parameters. 

Understanding multi-dimensional continuous spaces is difficult. As
three-dimensional beings we have real-world analogs for measurement, angle, and
position in three dimensions. We do not have these once we move beyond three
dimensions though. Nevertheless, visual analysis of these multi-dimensional
spaces has produced insights about the underlying
behavior~\cite{Sedlmair:2014,Gleicher:2016}. The issue is how to show more than
three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen. 

One strategy is to discretize the dataset through sampling and then use the
wealth of discrete visualization tools available. Much of the work on
multi-dimensional data analysis developed from analysis of 
tabular data. These datasets are often recorded from real-world
events such as census, species, or text data and contain many different aspects
about each entity. Thus, these datasets are inherently multi- or high-dimensional.
Each different aspect of the data items creates a dimension to be analyzed. 
In the case of these data the mental model is that of discrete objects
like humans, plants, or documents. Since the mental model is discrete in this
case it makes sense to use data processing and visualization tools designed for
discrete data.  However, our mental model for physical data is a continuous 
one. Therefore, the
discrete data paradigm breaks our mental model~\cite{Tory:2004a,Liu:2010a}. 
Breaking the mental model means that the visualization is not conveying the
complexities of the continuous phenomena.
Rather, we
should use visualization techniques purpose-built for continuous data.

While not as
extensively developed, there is previous work on visualizing multi-dimensional,
continuous data. These techniques can be broadly classified into projection,
topological, and slicing methods.  \ttwnote{put in chart from Jurgen's
presentation (projection vs dim reduction)?} Projection methods attempt to
distort the multi-dimensional object in order to view it on a two-dimensional
screen. With projection techniques we can preserve distance, direction, size,
or angles, but not all of 
these~\cite{Snyder:1987}. 
Depending on the
projection method, we may see radically different representations.  The issue
is that it is not clear from the resulting visualization what sort of
transformation was performed on the data.  Thus it can be difficult to
reconstruct the mental model of the multi-dimensional object.  One of the most
often seen multi-dimensional projection techniques is the Schlegel
diagram~\cite{Sommerville:1929} which picks a ``face'' of a polytope and projects the
remaining faces inside it. Thus, this technique only works for 4D polytopes.
Topological methods search the continuous dataset for values of interest, such
as critical points or contours.  Topological visualization techniques also
suffer from the issue of unclear transformation. It is difficult to relate the
resulting visualization back to features in the multi-dimensional object.

Slice-based views of multi-dimensional continuous spaces have not been explored
as extensively as other options.  This work began with the advent of
HyperSlice~\cite{Wijk:1993}.  HyperSlice extends the idea of slicing from
medical imaging to any number of dimensions.  HyperSlice provides the framework
for visualizing multi-dimensional continuous objects as a set of
two-dimensional slices.  There are $d \choose 2$ subpanels, one for each pair
of dimensions. Each panel shows a 2D slice of the object. The horizontal axis
shows one dimension and the vertical axis shows another dimension. Essentially,
each sub-plot of HyperSlice shows a 2D function plot. With 2D slices of solid
multi-dimensional objects color is often used to encode value. 

My work is inspired by the HyperSlice technique. Van Wijk and van Liere
introduced the idea of using slice-based views of multi-dimensional data.
However, they did not expand on what data types and tasks are involved in
multi-dimensional continuous data analysis.  I build on their work,
investigating the usefulness of slice-based views of continuous
multi-dimensional datasets. I also identified tasks involved in
multi-dimensional data analysis. The task analysis informed the development of
one- and two-dimensional slice-based views.

In this thesis I will explore
the possibilities of these slice-based views. Through a number of case
study examples, I will demonstrate the power of these views and ways to
address their shortcomings.
