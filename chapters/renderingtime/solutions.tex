\section{Application scenarios}
\label{sec:application_scenarios}

As was mentioned in \autoref{sec:motivation}, there are a number of ways to apply
our prediction methodology in a practical visualization system. 
To this end we show two application scenarios where our method can be
used to control the number of samples such that we maintain interactive 
rates.  We show how our method may be used 
to sample the simulation in order
to maintain a desired frame rate and to subsample an existing dataset in
order to attain interactive frame rates.

\subsection{Constrain sampling}
\label{sec:constrainsampling}

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{A prototypical example use case for our prediction formula,
 \autoref{eq:calib-acttotal-H}. The user
 is able to either enter the number of sample points directly in field (a)
 and the system displays the expected fps in (b) or enter the desired fps
 in (b) first and the system calculates the number of sample points.

\label{fig:sampler}
\end{figure}


\autoref{fig:sampler} is a dialog box for the Tuner~\cite{Torsney-Weir:2011} system. 
The task is
to enter the number of sample points to take from the simulation. The dialog
is driven by \autoref{eq:calib-acttotal-H}. When the user changes the number of
samples directly (a), the dialog computes the expected frame rate and displays
that to the user in (b). As an alternative method, the user may value
interactivity highly and consequently selects the number of sample points to
take by entering the desired frame rate (b) and letting the system select the
number of samples.

\subsection{Subsample points}
\label{sec:subsamplepoints}

The goal of this algorithm, presented as \autoref{algo:subsample} is to reduce the
sample size, $N$, such that the rendering time reaches an acceptable 30fps.
We will do this by removing samples from the set.  An issue with simply
removing points and rebuilding the Gaussian process model is that the
bandwidth parameters, $\theta$ will change.

In \autoref{fig:30fps_time} we show the trade-off between the radius, $r$, and the
number of points, $N$, that can be drawn in 30fps.  When subsampling data we
expect that the radius around each sample point will increase as we reduce
the number of sample points.  The goal of \autoref{algo:subsample} is to 
lower the number of sample points until we reach this line.

\ttwnote{put KwData back}
\begin{algorithm}
  %\KwData{Calibrated prediction formula $E[t_\text{total}^\text{H}](N, d, r)$,
           %calibrated GP model parameters $\vec{\theta}$}

  \begin{algorithmic}
    \State $t_\text{pred} \gets E[t_\text{total}^\text{H}](N, d, r)$\;
    \While{$t_\text{pred} < 30\text{fps}$}
      \State $N_\text{30fps} \gets$ Numerically solve $E[t_\text{total}^\text{H}](N, d, r)$ for an $N$ that will give 30fps rendering times\;
      \State Uniformly remove $N - N_\text{30fps}$ sample points\;
      \State $r' \gets$ Rebuild the GP model, thereby recomputing $r$\;
      \State $t_\text{pred} \gets E[t_\text{total}^\text{H}](N_\text{30fps}, d, r')$\;
    \EndWhile
  \end{algorithmic}

           interactive rendering times using the Gaussian process model
           with the HyperSlice rendering technique.  \label{algo:subsample}}
\end{algorithm}

In this fashion we can have a progressive rendering setup using 2 GP models, 
a low-resolution model for fast rendering and a high-resolution one for
detail views.  The system could dynamically switch between these two when
interacting.
