  In this paper we present a method for predicting the rendering time
  to display multi-dimensional data for the analysis of computer simulations
  using the HyperSlice~\cite{Wijk:1993} method with Gaussian process model
  reconstruction.  Our method relies on a theoretical understanding 
  of how the data points are drawn on slices and then fits the formula
  to a user's machine using practical experiments.
  We also describe the
  typical characteristics of data when analyzing 
  deterministic computer simulations
  as described by the statistics community.  We then show the advantage
  of carefully considering how many data points can be drawn in real time
  by proposing two approaches of
  how this predictive formula can be used in a real-world system.
