    The interface for browsing slices created by the Hypersliceplorer algorithm.
    We show a plot for each pair of dimensions laid out in the same way as
    HyperSlice~\cite{Wijk:1993}.
    The interface has two modes: global and local view.
    The global view (\subref{fig:interface:global}) 
    shows the results of sampling over a number of focus points. The views
    are linked through highlighting a slice. The local view 
    (\subref{fig:interface:local}) shows a single selected slice and then
    the user can add additional slices by clicking the ``+ fp'' button.

One-dimensional slices cannot do everything. When we are examining shapes then
we need to examine the relationship between dimensions. Thus, 2D slices are the
minimum number necessary to examine these relationships (see
\autoref{tbl:task_list}).  If we have a function describing the
multi-dimensional shape we are examining then we can generate two-dimensional
slices by constraining all but two of the parameters to a particular value and
then computing the two-dimensional outline directly. However, there are
domains, such as polytopes, where we have a simplical mesh of the continuous
object. In this case, we cannot use the dimension constraining method. In this
chapter, I develop an algorithm for generating two-dimensional slices of these
multi-dimensional simplical objects. 
This chapter is based on joint work with Torsten M{\"oller}, Michael Sedlmair,
and R. Mike Kirby currently under submission to the 20th EG/VGTC Conference
on Visualization (EuroVis 2018).
