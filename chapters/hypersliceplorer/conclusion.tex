\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we have presented Hypersliceplorer, an algorithm to compute
2D slices of multi-dimensional shapes defined as a simplical mesh. 
We also discussed an interactive interface we developed to view the slices.
We evaluated our method in two ways: through three target use case scenarios
and with measuring the running time.

In the future we will improve the speed of our algorithm by integrating a
spatial data structure such as a k-d tree or bounding box method. The current
algorithm needs to try and find an intersection with every simplex in the figure.
The data structure will help to avoid these extra checks. This should
improve the speed of our algorithm by avoiding unnecessary intersection tests.

Currently, we have only tested our method with convex hulls of shapes. We
plan to also examine the visualization possibilities with non-convex hulls
and with pre-generated hulls. Perhaps our method will lead to new insights
in mesh generation algorithms.

We will also work closely with target user groups to customize the interface
for their specific goals. For example, geometry users may more integration with
the Schlegel diagram while multi-objective optimization users may need better
support for local neighborhoods.
