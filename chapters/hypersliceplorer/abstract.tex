In this paper we present Hypersliceplorer, an algorithm for generating 2D
slices of multi-dimensional shapes defined by a simplical mesh.  Often, slices
are generated by using a parametric form and then constraining parameters to
view the slice. In our case, we developed an algorithm to slice a simplical
mesh of any number of dimensions with a two-dimensional slice.  In order to get
a global appreciation of the multi-dimensional object, we show multiple slices
by sampling a number of different slicing points and projecting the slices into
a single view per dimension pair. These slices are shown in an interactive
viewer which can switch between a global view (all slices) and a local view
(single slice). We show how this method can be used to study regular polytopes,
differences between spaces of polynomials, and multi-objective optimization
surfaces.
