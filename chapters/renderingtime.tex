With slicing the user should be able to interactively set the focus point to
any position they desire. If we cannot update the view quickly enough then this
will break the cognitive connection between the mental model of the user and
what they are viewing on screen~\cite{Shneiderman:1987}. The multi-dimensional
structures we are visualizing often have some regular geometric structure like
simplices or spheres.  In this chapter I examine how we can take advantage of
the power of the parallelism of the graphics processing unit on any modern
computer to create interactive-time focus point selection of multi-dimensional
objects~\cite{Torsney-Weir:2017}.
