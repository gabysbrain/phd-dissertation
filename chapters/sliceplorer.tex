    The evolution of Sliceplorer. I adapt the commonly known technique of
    1D function plots (a) to
    multiple dimensions by taking a small multiples approach and repeating each
    plot for each dimension (b). I address the
    focus point selection problem by sampling over the parameter space and then
    projecting the slices in the corresponding plot
    (c). The user can mouse over a particular
    slice in one plot and the corresponding slices are highlighted in the other
    dimension plots (d). This allows one to
    see the corresponding function behaviors in the other dimensions.  Finally,
    one can cluster the function slices (e), to
    show groups of similar behavior in the manifold.

First, we turn to the visual exploration of multi-dimensional continuous
functions. In this case, the user is primarily interested in the relationship
between dependent and independent variables. In this chapter, I discuss how
one-dimensional slices can be a highly intuitive way of visualizing
multi-dimensional manifolds. I also discuss how we can use projections of 
slices to address the focus point selection issue. The task analysis in this
chapter goes into detail about what sort of tasks one wants to perform when 
visualizing manifolds.
