First, we turn to the visual exploration of multi-dimensional continuous
functions. In this case, the user is primarily interested in the relationship
between dependent and independent variables.

    The evolution of Sliceplorer. I adapt the commonly known technique of
    1D function plots (a) to
    multiple dimensions by taking a small multiples approach and repeating each
    plot for each dimension (b). I address the
    focus point selection problem by sampling over the parameter space and then
    projecting the slices in the corresponding plot
    (c). The user can mouse over a particular
    slice in one plot and the corresponding slices are highlighted in the other
    dimension plots (d). This allows one to
    see the corresponding function behaviors in the other dimensions.  Finally,
    one can cluster the function slices (e), to
    show groups of similar behavior in the manifold.
