``the user must be able to project mental structures
onto the visual forms in constructing a coupled model.''~\cite{Liu:2010a}

One approach is to discretize the continious data and use the wealth of continuous
data processing methods to view the data. There are a number of methods that
discretize data in an intelligent fashion~\cite{shannon, etc}. 

\begin{itemize}
\item what about discrete data?
\item why is this important?
\end{itemize}

However, when visualizing continuous phenomena, it is important to keep in mind
the mental model of the user~\cite{Liu:2010a}.

\begin{itemize}
\item issue: ranges - why? where do they come from?
\item issue: treating dimensions equally
\item issue: understanding mapping relationships
\end{itemize}
