In my own work, I address these two critical issues. The navigation issue can
be solved with sampling. With both Sliceplorer (\autoref{chp:sliceplorer}) and
HyperSliceplorer (\autoref{chp:hypersliceplorer}), I sample over a number of
focus points and display them all at once. In \autoref{chp:rendering}, I
discuss how we can take advantage of the multi-dimensional geometry to allow
interactive-speed browsing of the focus points. My goal is to highlight the
advantages of slice-based methods for multi-dimensional data analysis. At the
same time I want to address the limitations. The end goal is to bring
slice-based views into the standard toolbox of visualizations.
