\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we have presented Sliceplorer, a visualization method for
multi-dimensional functions based on one-dimensional slices. We defined a task
taxonomy specific to multi-dimensional continuous functions and found that,
while some state of the art techniques are very good at  addressing specific
tasks, our method supports a wide variety of tasks. Consequently, our technique
may be a good first pass when visualizing multi-dimensional continuous functions. 
It is easy to implement, easy to understand, and addresses a greater variety
of tasks than any other technique.
