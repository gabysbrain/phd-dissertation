Multi-dimensional continuous functions are commonly visualized with 2D slices
or topological views. Here, we explore 1D slices as an alternative approach to
show such functions. Our goal with 1D slices is to combine the benefits of
topological views, that is, screen space efficiency, with those of slices, that
is a close resemblance of the underlying function.  We compare 1D slices to 2D
slices and topological views, first, by looking at their performance with
respect to common function analysis tasks. We also demonstrate 3 usage
scenarios: the 2D sinc function, neural network regression, and optimization
traces. Based on this evaluation, we characterize the advantages and
drawbacks of each of these approaches, and show how interaction can be
used to overcome some of the shortcomings.
