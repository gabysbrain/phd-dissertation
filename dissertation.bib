		  data are sampled from a density with many modes, one mode
		  for each cluster. Methods of estimating multivariate
		  densities may therefore be converted to clustering
		  techniques, and clustering techniques may be helpful in
		  estimating multivariate densities. Graphical techniques for
		  representing clusters are closely related to multivariate
		  histograms. Block histograms in two dimensions are
		  constructed by finding a rectangle of minimum area
		  containing a fixed number of points, deleting this
		  rectangle and the points it contains, then finding another
		  rectangle of minimum area containing a fixed number of
		  points and so on. These histograms are simple visual
		  representations of a density estimate in two dimensions.
		  Analogous block histograms in many dimensions are useful
		  but more difficult to represent graphically. A different
		  approach represents each point by a box drawn in three or
		  more dimensions. If the points are first ordered by some
		  other clustering technique, the similarity of neighbouring
		  boxes suggests or denies the presence of clusters. },

		  is to rank alternative solutions by weighted summary
		  scores. Weights, however, are often abstract to the
		  decision maker and can only be set by vague intuition.
		  While previous work supports a point-wise exploration of
		  weight spaces, we argue that MCDM can benefit from a
		  regional and global visual analysis of weight spaces. Our
		  main contribution is WeightLifter, a novel interactive
		  visualization technique for weight-based MCDM that
		  facilitates the exploration of weight spaces with up to ten
		  criteria. Our technique enables users to better understand
		  the sensitivity of a decision to changes of weights, to
		  efficiently localize weight regions where a given solution
		  ranks high, and to filter out solutions which do not rank
		  high enough for any plausible combination of weights. We
		  provide a comprehensive requirement analysis for
		  weight-based MCDM and describe an interactive workflow that
		  meets these requirements. For evaluation, we describe a
		  usage scenario of WeightLifter in automotive engineering
		  and report qualitative feedback from users of a deployed
		  version as well as preliminary feedback from decision
		  makers in multiple domains. This feedback confirms that
		  WeightLifter increases both the efficiency of weight-based
		  MCDM and the awareness of uncertainty in the ultimate
		  decisions.},

		  analysis and decision making tasks. However, how people
		  perceive and interact with a visualization tool can
		  strongly influence their understanding of the data as well
		  as the system's usefulness. Human factors therefore
		  contribute significantly to the visualization process and
		  should play an important role in the design and evaluation
		  of visualization tools. Several research initiatives have
		  begun to explore human factors in visualization,
		  particularly in perception-based design. Nonetheless,
		  visualization work involving human factors is in its
		  infancy, and many potentially promising areas have yet to
		  be explored. Therefore, we aim to 1) review known
		  methodology for doing human factors research, with specific
		  emphasis on visualization, 2) review current human factors
		  research in visualization to provide a basis for future
		  investigation, and 3) identify promising areas for future
		  research.},

		  methods. Smoothing meth- ods use computing power to give

		  effectively, by taking advantage of people's abilities to
		  draw conclusions from well-designed graphics. Data analysts

		  discrete data values with two data variables as a
		  collection of discrete points. We aim at generalizing the
		  concept of scatterplots to the visualization of spatially
		  continuous input data by a continuous and dense plot. An
		  example of a continuous input field is data defined on an
		  n-D spatial grid with respective interpolation or
		  reconstruction of in-between values. We propose a rigorous,
		  accurate, and generic mathematical model of continuous
		  scatterplots that considers an arbitrary density defined on
		  an input field on an n-D domain and that maps this density
		  to m-D scatterplots. Special cases are derived from this
		  generic model and discussed in detail: scatterplots where
		  the n-D spatial domain and the m-D data attribute domain
		  have identical dimension, 1-D scatterplots as a way to
		  define continuous histograms, and 2-D scatterplots of data
		  on 3-D spatial grids. We show how continuous histograms are
		  related to traditional discrete histograms and to the
		  histograms of isosurface statistics. Based on the
		  mathematical model of continuous scatterplots, respective
		  visualization algorithms are derived, in particular for 2-D
		  scatterplots of data from 3-D tetrahedral grids. For
		  several visualization tasks, we show the applicability of
		  continuous scatterplots. Since continuous scatterplots do
		  not only sample data at grid points but interpolate data
		  values within cells, a dense and complete visualization of
		  the data set is achieved that scales well with increasing
		  data set size. Especially for irregular grids with varying
		  cell size, improved results are obtained when compared to
		  conventional scatterplots. Therefore, continuous
		  scatterplots are a suitable extension of a statistics
		  visualization technique to be applied to typical data from
		  scientific computation.},

		  and partial differential equation solvers are typically
		  given in the form of non-rectilinear grids. The splatting
		  technique is a popular direct volume rendering algorithm,
		  which can provide high quality ren- dering results, but has
		  been mainly described for rectilinear grids. In splatting,
		  each voxel is represented by a 3D kernel weighted by the
		  discrete voxel value. While the 3D reconstruction kernels
		  for rectilinear grids can be easily constructed based on
		  the distance among the aligned voxels, for irregular grids
		  the kernel construction is significantly more complicated.
		  In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a 3D
		  Delaunay triangulation to create 3D elliptical Gaussian
		  kernels, which then can be used by a splatting algorithm
		  for the rendering of irregular grids. Our method does not
		  require a resampling of the irregular grid. Instead, we use
		  a weighted least squares method to fit a 3D elliptical
		  Gaussian centered at each grid point, approximating its
		  Voronoi cell. The resulting 3D elliptical Gaussians are
		  represented using a convenient matrix representation, which
		  allows them to be seamlessly incorporated into our

  abstract      = {An important goal of scientific data analysis is to
		  understand the behavior of a system or process based on a
		  sample of the system. In many instances it is possible to
		  observe both input parameters and system outputs, and
		  characterize the system as a high-dimensional function.
		  Such data sets arise, for instance, in large numerical
		  simulations, as energy landscapes in optimization problems,
		  or in the analysis of image data relating to biological or
		  medical parameters. This paper proposes an approach to
		  analyze and visualizing such data sets. The proposed method
		  combines topological and geometric techniques to provide
		  interactive visualizations of discretely sampled
		  high-dimensional scalar fields. The method relies on a
		  segmentation of the parameter space using an approximate
		  Morse-Smale complex on the cloud of point samples. For each
		  crystal of the Morse-Smale complex, a regression of the
		  system parameters with respect to the output yields a curve
		  in the parameter space. The result is a simplified
		  geometric representation of the Morse-Smale complex in the
		  high dimensional input domain. Finally, the geometric
		  representation is embedded in 2D, using dimension
		  reduction, to provide a visualization platform. The
		  geometric properties of the regression curves enable the
		  visualization of additional information about each crystal
		  such as local and global shape, width, length, and sampling
		  densities. The method is illustrated on several synthetic
		  examples of two dimensional functions. Two use cases, using
		  data sets from the UCI machine learning repository,
		  demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach on real
		  data. Finally, in collaboration with domain experts the
		  proposed method is applied to two scientific challenges.
		  The analysis of parameters of climate simulations and their
		  relationship to predicted global energy flux and the
		  concentrations of chemical species in a combustion
		  simulation and their integration with temperature.},

		  data. It makes three contributions to visualization: (i) a

  abstract      = {Design studies are an increasingly popular form of
		  problem-driven visualization research, yet there is little
		  guidance available about how to do them effectively. In
		  this paper we reflect on our combined experience of
		  conducting twenty-one design studies, as well as reading
		  and reviewing many more, and on an extensive literature
		  review of other field work methods and methodologies. Based
		  on this foundation we provide definitions, propose a
		  methodological framework, and provide practical guidance
		  for conducting design studies. We define a design study as
		  a project in which visualization researchers analyze a
		  specific real-world problem faced by domain experts, design
		  a visualization system that supports solving this problem,
		  validate the design, and reflect about lessons learned in
		  order to refine visualization design guidelines. We
		  characterize two axes {\&}amp;{\#}8212; a task clarity axis
		  from fuzzy to crisp and an information location axis from
		  the domain expert{\&}amp;{\#}8217;s head to the computer
		  {\&}amp;{\#}8212; and use these axes to reason about design
		  study contributions, their suitability, and uniqueness from
		  other approaches. The proposed methodological framework
		  consists of 9 stages: learn, winnow, cast, discover,
		  design, implement, deploy, reflect, and write. For each
		  stage we provide practical guidance and outline potential
		  pitfalls. We also conducted an extensive literature survey
		  of related methodological approaches that involve a
		  significant amount of qualitative field work, and compare
		  design study methodology to that of ethnography, grounded
		  theory, and action research. View full abstract},

		  mask other outliers, and e) dealing consistently with

		  is based on a distributional model that allows outliers to
		  be tagged with a probability. This critical feature reduces
		  the likelihood of false discoveries.},
